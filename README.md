# D&D (5e) Monster Manager
A bare-bones program that allows you to manage your monsters in D&D 5e. It's totally possible to screw up the program or prevent it from running because I don't feel like making it impervious to error, but if you know how to use it this thing can be super useful.

To run this, use your command line of choice to run startup.py. A bin_scenes file will be created automatically, which uses python's pickle module to store scenes and the mosnters within them.
