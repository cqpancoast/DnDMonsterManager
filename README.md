# D&D (5e) Monster Manager
A bare-bones program that allows you to manage your monsters in D&D 5e. It's totally possible to screw up the program or prevent it from running because I don't feel like making it impervious to error, but if you know how to use it this thing can be super useful.

To run this, use your command line of choice to run startup.py. A bin_scenes file will be created automatically, which uses python's pickle module to store scenes and the mosnters within them.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The only way to really fuck with this program is to name multiple scenes or multiple monsters the same thing. Fixing this is more trouble than it's worth for me, so just don't do it. If you DO do it, you absolute cretin, this doesn't permanently mess with the program - all you have to do to get it working again is to delete all of the copies except one, and it should work fine again.
